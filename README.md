Godot Demo Browser is a tool for browsing through the Godot demos.
From this browser you can play demos, edit them in Godot, or view
them on the Godot Asset Library or on GitHub.

In order for the browser to work, a copy of the
[Godot demo projects](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects)
must be present in the same directory as the Godot Demo Browser.
**This is already included in the Itch release.**
You can also include your own projects and it will attempt to read them
(it will recursively search for projects in subdirectories).
